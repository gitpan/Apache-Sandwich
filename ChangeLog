	* Change: make the sandwiched document delivered directly rather
	than via a virtual include.  This saves the dispatch time and also 
	allows us to verify the file exists before we do anything further.

	* Rewrite: since it only works for GET method objects, ensure we
	are using GET.  Document as such in the POD section of the file.

	* Cleanup: Cleaned up code to reduce warnings to error log.
