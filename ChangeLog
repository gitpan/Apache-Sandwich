	* Sandwich.pm (handler): instead of using a direct file send after
 	opening the file, call a specified handler to serve the document.
  	If no handler is specified, use "default-handler".  This allows us
 	to use SSI documents inside the sandwich.

	* Sandwich.pm (handler): if file is not "plain text" as defined by 
	Perl, DECLINE to handle it.  Idea/request from Gil Vidals.

	* Change: make the sandwiched document delivered directly rather
	than via a virtual include.  This saves the dispatch time and also 
	allows us to verify the file exists before we do anything further.

	* Rewrite: since it only works for GET method objects, ensure we
	are using GET.  Document as such in the POD section of the file.

	* Cleanup: Cleaned up code to reduce warnings to error log.
